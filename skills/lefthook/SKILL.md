description: Create, explain, review, and troubleshoot Lefthook hook configurations for Git repositories. Use when Codex needs to author or update `lefthook.yml`, `.lefthook.yml`, `lefthook-local.*`, explain `commands` vs `jobs` vs `scripts`, wire up `install` or `run` or `dump` or `validate`, add hook automation such as linting or formatting or commit message checks, or debug why a Lefthook setup does not behave as expected.

# Lefthook

Create or update Lefthook configuration with exact option names, practical defaults, and clear debugging steps. Explain the tool briefly, then focus on producing a working config for the current repository.

## Start Here

Inspect the repository before writing anything.

- Look for existing config files first: `lefthook.yml`, `.lefthook.yml`, `.config/lefthook.yml`, `lefthook.yaml`, `lefthook.toml`, `lefthook.json`, `lefthook.jsonc`, and matching `lefthook-local.*` overrides.
- Preserve the existing format and naming if a config already exists.
- Prefer YAML `lefthook.yml` for new setups unless the repo already standardizes on TOML, JSON, or JSONC.
- Read package manager files, script directories, and CI or lint tooling before proposing hook commands.
- Keep one main format per project. Do not introduce a second main Lefthook config format.

## Author Configs

Choose the simplest structure that fits the workflow.

- Prefer `commands` for straightforward named tasks such as linting, formatting, tests, or commit message checks.
- Prefer `jobs` when order, grouping, `parallel`, `piped`, mixed `run` and `script` entries, or merge-friendly named jobs matter.
- Use `scripts` only when the repository already uses executable files under `source_dir/<hook>/` or when the user explicitly wants file-based scripts.
- Prefer hook names that match real Git hooks such as `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, and `pre-push`. It is also valid to define custom task groups and run them through `lefthook run <name>`.
- Keep commands local to the repo toolchain. Reuse existing `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`, `go`, `bundle`, `uv`, or shell commands instead of inventing new wrappers.
- Use file templates deliberately: `{staged_files}` for `pre-commit`, `{push_files}` for `pre-push`, `{all_files}` for whole-repo checks, `{files}` when a custom `files:` command is defined, `{cmd}` for local wrapping, and `{1}` for hook arguments such as `commit-msg`.
- Add `stage_fixed: true` only when the command actually rewrites tracked files and should re-stage them.
- Use `glob`, `exclude`, `file_types`, and `root` to keep commands narrow and fast.
- Reach for `lefthook-local.*` when the user wants local-only skips, Docker wrappers, or private overrides that should not change the shared team config.

Read [overview.md](./references/overview.md) for install and command flow, [config-model.md](./references/config-model.md) for structure and merge behavior, [patterns.md](./references/patterns.md) for common recipes, [best-practices.md](./references/best-practices.md) when the user asks for battle-tested guidance, and [schema-cheatsheet.md](./references/schema-cheatsheet.md) for exact keys.

## Explain And Debug

Explain Lefthook in terms of repository behavior, not marketing.

- Describe it as a Git hook manager that reads config on each run and executes repo-defined commands or scripts.
- Mention that `lefthook install` installs Git hook entrypoints and creates an empty config if none exists.
- Mention that config changes do not require reinstall in normal cases because hooks read config each time they run.
- Use `lefthook validate` to check configuration validity.
- Use `lefthook dump` to inspect the effective merged config after `extends`, `remotes`, and `lefthook-local.*`.
- Use `lefthook run <hook>` with `--all-files`, `--file`, `--job`, or `--tag` to reproduce hook behavior outside `git commit` or `git push`.
- Explain merge precedence as: main config, then `extends`, then `remotes`, then `lefthook-local.*`.
- When using the phrase "best practice", keep exact behavior grounded in the bundled docs and schema, and treat blog-derived patterns as workflow guidance rather than hard requirements.

When reviewing an existing config, call out:

- commands that will not match any files because placeholders and filters do not align;
- rewriters that forgot `stage_fixed: true`;
- file-wide commands incorrectly using `{staged_files}`;
- unnecessary complexity where `commands` would be enough;
- local overrides that should live in `lefthook-local.*` instead of shared config.

## Use Bundled Resources

- Copy starter snippets from `assets/` when a user wants a quick starting point.
- Load `references/patterns.md` for concrete recipes before drafting a non-trivial config.
- Load `references/best-practices.md` when the user explicitly asks for recommendations or wants rationale backed by real-world Lefthook usage.
- Load `references/schema-cheatsheet.md` when exact option spelling or allowed nesting matters.
- Keep explanations compact in the final answer. Include only the options that matter for the current repository.
